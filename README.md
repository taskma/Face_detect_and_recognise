# Face Detecting and Recognising 
Using Opencv and  Tensorflow-keras for capturing faces and deep learning on CNN

The codes can running on  Rasberry Pie 3, Rasberry Pie 4 and PC (tested)

Model accuracy is almost %98

1) Run capturing_faces.py for diffrent users (using opencv for capturing faces from camera)

2) Run learning_faces.py for learning user faces (using tensorflow-keras for cnn deep learning)

3) Run Recognise_faces.py for  recognising faces that learned (using opencv and tensorflow-keras)
